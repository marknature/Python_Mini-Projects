You have just joined a mining company called Visus Mines, and your first task is to write a Python program to embed into an Arduino Uno Controller. The program will control a wind turbine safety system. The safety system uses three inputs (Turbine Speed, Bearing Temperature, and Wind Velocity) to determine whether the turbine should be shut down.Problem Description: You have just joined a mining company called Visus Mines, and your first task is to write a Python program to embed into an Arduino Uno Controller.
